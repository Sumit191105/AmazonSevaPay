# Amazon Seva Pay
Offline Smart Payment System for Rural India – Even works without Internet!

##  Problem
67% of rural India does not have reliable internet.  
People can't pay online → Amazon loses ₹1,200+ crore every year in failed COD orders.  
We needed a solution that works *even when there's no internet*.

##  Our Solution: Amazon Seva Pay

We use local shopkeepers as 'Payment Ambassadors'.  
Customer gives cash → shopkeeper scans QR using our app → payment is stored offline → it syncs later when internet comes back.

1.Works offline for 72 hours  
2.Shopkeeper earns ₹3-5 per transaction  
3.Needs only basic Android phone

## How It Works

1. Customer generates Amazon order QR.
2. Walks to nearby tea stall/mobile shop (Ambassador).
3. Shopkeeper scans QR and accepts cash.
4. App stores transaction offline.
5. When internet is available, app auto-syncs.
6. Order confirmed. Shopkeeper gets commission.

Simple. Reliable. Offline.
